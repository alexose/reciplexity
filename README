== Reciplexity alpha

= What?

Reciplexity is a tool for creating unusual ingredient combinations based on existing recipe data.

The goal of the project is to find ingredients that should pair well together but don't appear in many recipes.  

Future goals will include adding other dimensions, such as cooking techniques, to the existing data.

= How?

This is a two-part project.  At this time, only the first part is being actively developed.
    1) Building a useful recipe database
    2) Clustering ingredents and displaying results.
